# Final_Project_Nico_Ironhack

Overview:

This project focuses on the analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling of an e-commerce dataset. Through rigorous exploratory data analysis (EDA), Tableau visualizations, and machine learning, we aim to derive insights that can drive informed business decisions and improve our chunr rate.

Features:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Basic metrics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
Visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand data distribution.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying how variables relate to each other.

2. Machine Learning
Logistic Regression: Initial model tested.
SMOTE: Resampling technique used to address class imbalance issues.
Random Forest: Final model chosen, providing an accuracy of 85% post-resampling.

3. Tableau Visualizations
Key Metrics Display: Real-time overview of sales, revenue, and other critical metrics.
Segmentation: Analysis of customer groups or product categories.
Recency Plot: Visualization of customer purchase behavior over time.
Dynamic Metrics: Interactive filters to view data by date, category, or region.


What to Expect?

Insights on Customer Behavior: Understand the purchase patterns, preferences, and behaviors of your customer base.
Sales Forecasting: Using the machine learning models, predict future sales and optimize inventory management.
Operational Efficiency: Spot bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the sales process.
Interactive Dashboards: Real-time insights with the ability to drill down into specifics using Tableau.
